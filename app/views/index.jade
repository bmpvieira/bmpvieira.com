            #Welcome
            I'm a computational biologist at the [Computational Biology and 
            Population Genomics Group (CoBiGÂ²)](http://cobig2.fc.ul.pt), from the [Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon](http://www.fc.ul.pt).

            This is my personal website, where I'll host my projects, curriculum and eventually a blog.

            It's still under heavy development but you can in the meantime check out my [resume](/cv)! ^_^'

            My current interests are Next-generation sequencing, Cloud computing, Python, Node.js, Scala, NoSQL (Neo4j) and web apps (among others).
